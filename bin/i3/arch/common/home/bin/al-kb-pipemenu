HELP='\tal-kb-pipemenu an Openbox Pipe Menu for displaying keybinds
\tIt should normally be called from an openbox menu.
\nOptions (usually passed from the menu):
\t-h --help   show this message
\t--keybinds  display keybindings defined in rc.xml as a menu
\t(The keybinds in the menu are clickable, except for the Openbox
\tcommands, which just exit the menu.)
\t--rcedit    backup and edit rc.xml
\nIf al-keyboard-pipemenu is called with no options (the usual method),
it will output an xml openbox pipemenu for displaying keybindings.
\tNOTE: Some of the functionality of this pipemenu depends on the script
/usr/bin/al-kb which is provided by the package "archlabs-utilities"'
