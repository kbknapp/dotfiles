# `.zlogin` is sourced in login shells after `.zshrc`.
#
# It should contain commands that should be executed only in login
# shells. `.zlogout` is sourced when login shells exit.  `.zprofile` and
# `.zlogin` are not intended to be used together (the former is provided as an
# alternative for `ksh` fans). 
#
# `.zlogin` is not the place for alias definitions, options, environment
# variable settings, etc.; as a general rule, it should not change the shell
# environment at all. Rather, it should be used to set the terminal type and
# run a series of external commands (`fortune`, `msgs`, etc).
